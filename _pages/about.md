<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed human lives in the 21st century. The impact of AI has been widespread and profound; it has reshaped health and medicine, modes of travel, marketplaces, finance and trading, social interactions, and security services. As AI has made giant strides, the research community, in collaboration with experts from various domains, has used the power of data to address complex societal problems. Indeed, in the last few decades, AI has been used to help conserve endangered species, aid drug discovery and precision surgery, detect anomalies in medical imaging, improve emergency and disaster response, design markets for organ exchange, and address homelessness, among others. However, as AI has been used to perform decision-making, concerns about privacy, security, fairness, and interpretability of the decisions made (or suggested) by technology have also emerged. As a result, AI researchers and practitioners need to tread cautiously to ensure that AI systems do not exacerbate existing biases and discrimination in our society or introduce new challenges. The AI community has taken on this challenge and has started exploring how such effects of AI can be quantified and mitigated. This webpage serves as a collection of pre-print essays to be published by ACM as a book titled "Artificial Intelligence for Social Good." The book is edited by Yevgeniy Vorobeychik and Ayan Mukhopadhyay. Our goal is to collate contributions from leading AI researchers whose work has advanced the algorithmic state-of-the-art in AI and made significant contributions to society. We also envision the book to discuss issues raised by the widespread use of AI systems, such as privacy, security, and equity. The proposed collection of essays will be suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate-level courses.</p>
